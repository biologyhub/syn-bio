Given a suitably accurate method for computing the energy of a protein chain,
as well as methods for sampling the space of possible protein structures and
sequences, it should be possible to design sequences that fold into new
structures.

There are two challenges in implementing this approach:

1. the energy of a system cannot be computed with perfect accuracy, and
2. the space of possible structures and sequences is very large and difficult to search comprehensively.

Developments enabling _de novo_ protein design:

1. Availability of computing power
2. Synthetic manufacture of DNA
